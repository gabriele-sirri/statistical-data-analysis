This repository contains the materials for **Module 3** of the _Statistical Data Analysis for Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics_ course, part of the Master’s Degree in Physics at the University of Bologna.

The module focuses on selected statistical analysis cases in High Energy Physics (HEP), using **RooFit** and **RooStats** as the main tools.

## Computing Environment

The reference environment is **Linux Ubuntu 24.04** running on **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2**, as used in the laboratory computers.

The essential software components are **ROOT** and **Jupyter**.  
The recommended code editor is **Visual Studio Code**.

**Complete installation guide:**  
[WSL Setup Guide with ROOT, Jupyter, and VS Code (Ubuntu 24.04)](./howto/root_on_wsl.md)

Other Linux distributions, as well as native **Windows** or **macOS** systems, are also suitable—provided the required software tools are properly installed.

Cloud-based alternatives (non-persistent):  
- [ROOT on Colab](./howto/root_on_colab.ipynb)  
- [ROOT on Binder](./howto/root_on_binder.md)
